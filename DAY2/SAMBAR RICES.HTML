<h1>SAMBAR RICES</h1>
<p>rice as a combination is a favorite of mine. I’m sure it is also for a lot of other people too. But what if I give you a way to enjoy this pair, originally hurled up into a one-pot meal? Won’t it be all the more awesome? That’s what this delicious Sambar Rice recipe is all about. This Sambar Sadam is a lot like the famous Bisi Bele Bath of Karnataka in South India, just the taste is different. Try this way of having a comforting and healthy meal this time, go for it!</p>
