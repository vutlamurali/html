<h1>POORI</h1>
<p>The name Puri derives from the Sanskrit word पूरिका (pūrikā), from पुर (pura) "filled".[1] In other South Asian languages it is known as: Urdu: پوری (𝘱𝘰𝘰𝘳𝘪), Dogri: पूरी (pūrī) or पूड़ी (pūṛī), Kumaoni: लगड (lagaḍ), Tamil: பூரி (poori), Telugu: పూరి (pūri), Gujarati: પૂરી, Assamese: পুৰি (puri), Bengali: পুরি (pūri), Hindi: पूड़ी (pūṛī), Bhojpuri: पूड़ी (pūṛī), Marathi: पूरी (pūrī), Kannada: ಪೂರಿ (pūri), Malayalam: പൂരി (pūrī), Burmese: ပူရီ (pūrī), Nepali: पूरी (puri), Odia: ପୁରି (puri), Punjabi: ਪੂਰੀ (pūṛī), Garhwali: पूरी (pūrī), [2]

Ingredients
Puris are prepared with wheat flour, either atta (whole wheat flour) or sooji (coarse wheat flour). In some recipes, ajwain, cumin seed, spinach, or fenugreek seeds are added to the dough. The dough is either rolled out in a small circle or rolled out and cut out in small circles, then deep fried in ghee or vegetable oil. While deep frying, puris puff up like a round ball because moisture in the dough changes into steam which expands in all directions. When they are golden-brown in color, they are removed and either served hot or saved for later use (as with the snack food pani puri). Rolled puris may be pricked with a fork before deep frying to make flat puris for chaat like bhel puri. A punctured puri does not puff when cooked because the steam escapes as it cooks.</p>
