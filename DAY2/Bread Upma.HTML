<h1>Bread Upma</h1>
<p>Realistically speaking, bread upma is nothing like the classic rava upma. But it’s so convenient and are we all not looking for easy breakfast ideas? I know I am! You literally need not more than 15-20 minutes to make this dish. Most of time involved in making this dish is the prep time. Once you have chopped everything, it’s just a matter of few minutes till it all comes together. It is also a great way to use leftover bread.

You may use any bread for this upma. I had some white bread at home and that’s what I used in this recipe. You may use brown bread, multi-grain, even dinner rolls/pav will work. For the bread upma, the bread is cut into small pieces and then cooked along with a masala made of onion, tomatoes, ginger, curry leaves, mustard seeds and then topped with roasted peanuts and fresh cilantro. It is so good with chai!.</p>
